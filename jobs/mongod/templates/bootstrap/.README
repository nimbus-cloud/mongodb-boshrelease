To bootstrap replica set and create an admin user:

1. Pick a non-arbiter node after all nodes are deployed
2. Ssh into that node, go to /var/vcap/jobs/mongod/bootstrap
3. Bootstrap replica set: mongo replica_set.js
4. Wait for a while for the replica set to initiate, the node on which bootstrap was done will become primary after few seconds
5. Create admin user: mongo create_admin_user.js

Currently I cannot think of a way of automating this, hence these two scripts has to be run manually.

Automation is problematic because:
1. Our deployment is stretched across two DC (deployed with 2 different boshes)
2. These two scripts should be run when all vms have been deployed. See (1)
3. Because we have a replica set name in the config, it is not possible to create admin user
before replica set is bootstrapped.
